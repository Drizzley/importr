## Excel Importr for RepairShopr ##

This is a javascript app hiding inside a rails app!

Inspired from a cool blog post about using sheetjs and handsontable to do excel imports.

### What it does now ###

- You can drag a spreadsheet in, put in your API Key and Subdomain, and do an import of old Tickets to RepairShopr
- You can run just a couple rows if you want, and you can target staging
- You can come back to the link later or share it, and view the results of the import
- You can import tickets

### What it will do soon ###

- handle imports for customers, invoices, and assets!
- allow you to right-click on column headings to do the field mapping instead of typing the field names
- allow you to right-click date column headings to select the date format, and more date options (like mm-dd-yy, etc)
